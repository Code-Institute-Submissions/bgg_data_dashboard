# Board game data dashboard

This project will be a webpage showing data from the [BoardGameGeek] (https://www.boardgamegeek.com) website (for those who are unaware of it, you can think of it as being for modern board games what IMDB is for movies), rendered into various charts, from which data can be selected, which will then have an effect on the other charts. So it will be easily possible to see things like how many new games were released in particular years, what their average ratings are, what mechanics are most commonly used - and any other data which I decide to use and display.

The data is gathered using the [official BGG API] (https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API2), using [the Python package for accessing it] (http://lcosmin.github.io/boardgamegeek) developed by Tom Usher and Brent Ropp after Phil S. Stein and Geoff Lawler. I have not attempted to access all games in the BGG database - there are currently over 90,000 of these, the number is steadily rising, and the vast majority have very few user ratings. Indeed there are even many pages for as-yet-unreleased games. I have made the conscious decision to use only those games with a sufficiently large number of ratings - both to keep the dataset manageable and also to give it more meaning because all the games referred to will be reasonably popular and/or well-known within the hoby.At the moment I plan to use only the 100 games with the most ratings (all games in this list have over 2000 ratings), although this may change in the future. In order to get a list of BGG game ids to pass to the API, I have used [BeautifulSoup] (https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) to parse the relevant BGG ranking pages and extract the numbers.

The data is stored in and accessed from a [MongoDB] (https://www.mongodb.com) collection in the back end. The site itself will be run from a [Flask] (http://flask.pocoo.org) app, and the data will be manipulated using [Crossfilter] (http://square.github.io/crossfilter), with the graphs handled by [dc.js] (http://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/docs/html), which itself uses by [d3.js] (https://d3js.org/).  

This project will be submitted for Stream 2 of the [Code Institute's] (https://www.codeinstitute.net) Full Stack developer course.
